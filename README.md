## üåü Overview

Flow is a modern, intuitive web application designed to simplify and democratize web scraping and data extraction. It empowers users of all technical levels to create sophisticated automation workflows through a visual, drag-and-drop interface, eliminating the need for complex coding. Whether you're a marketer, researcher, data analyst, or developer, Flow provides the tools to efficiently gather data from the web.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### üé® Visual Workflow Builder
- **Drag & Drop Interface**: Intuitively construct complex scraping logic by connecting pre-built nodes.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Visualize your automation flow as you build it, making debugging easier.
- **Extensive Task Library**: Access a rich library of nodes for common scraping operations like navigation, data extraction, conditional logic, and data transformation.
- **Customizable Nodes**: Configure each node with specific parameters to tailor its behavior.
- **Workflow Versioning**: Save and manage different versions of your automation flows.

### üöÄ Powerful Automation Engine
- **Headless Browser Support**: Utilizes technologies like Puppeteer or Playwright for robust interaction with modern, JavaScript-heavy websites.
- **Multi-page Scraping**: Easily configure workflows to navigate through pagination, follow links, and scrape data across multiple pages.
- **Diverse Data Extraction**: Extract various data types including text, HTML, attributes, images, and structured data (e.g., tables, lists).
- **Data Transformation**: Clean, format, and restructure extracted data directly within the workflow using built-in transformation nodes.
- **Proxy Management**: Integrate with proxy services to manage IP rotation and avoid blocks.
- **User-Agent Spoofing**: Customize user agents to mimic different browsers and devices.

### üìä Scheduling & Monitoring
- **Flexible Scheduling**: Set up workflows to run at specific intervals (e.g., hourly, daily, weekly) or on demand.
- **Execution Dashboard**: Monitor the status and progress of running and completed workflows.
- **Detailed Logs**: Access comprehensive logs for each execution to troubleshoot issues.
- **Notifications**: Receive alerts for workflow completion, errors, or important events.
- **Analytics**: Gain insights into scraping performance, data volume, and success rates.

### üîê Data Management & Export
- **Secure Storage**: Store extracted data securely within the application or integrate with external databases.
- **Multiple Export Formats**: Export scraped data in various formats like CSV, JSON, Excel, or directly to APIs.
- **API Access**: Programmatically trigger workflows and retrieve data via a RESTful API.

### üë§ User & Access Management (If applicable)
- **User Authentication**: Secure user accounts and data.
- **Team Collaboration**: (Optional) Allow multiple users to collaborate on workflows within an organization.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: (Optional) Define different permission levels for users.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local development copy of Flow up and running.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version X.X.X or higher - specify your version)
- pnpm (or npm/yarn - specify your package manager)
- A running instance of PostgreSQL (or your chosen database)
- API keys for any third-party services (e.g., Clerk, OpenAI if used)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/flow-web-scraper.git
    cd flow-web-scraper/apps/web
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env.local` file in the `apps/web` directory by copying the example file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env.local
    ```
    Update the `.env.local` file with your specific configuration:
    ```properties
    # Database
    DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:port/database?sslmode=require"

    # Authentication (e.g., Clerk)
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="pk_your_clerk_publishable_key"
    CLERK_SECRET_KEY="sk_your_clerk_secret_key"

    # Other API Keys or configurations
    # OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your_openrouter_key_if_used"
    # ENCRYPTION_KEY="your_strong_encryption_key_for_sensitive_data"
    ```

4.  **Initialize the database schema:**
    ```bash
    pnpm prisma generate
    pnpm prisma db push # Or pnpm prisma migrate dev for development migrations
    ```

5.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```
    The application should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## üìñ Usage Guide

1.  **Sign Up / Log In**: Create an account or log in to access the dashboard.
2.  **Create a New Workflow**: Navigate to the "Workflows" section and click "Create New".
3.  **Design Your Flow**:
    *   Drag nodes (e.g., "Open URL", "Click Element", "Extract Data", "Save Data") from the sidebar onto the canvas.
    *   Connect the nodes in the desired sequence to define the automation logic.
    *   Configure each node's properties (e.g., URL to visit, CSS selectors for elements, data fields to extract).
4.  **Test Your Workflow**: Use the "Run Test" feature to execute the workflow on a small scale and verify its output.
5.  **Save and Schedule**: Once satisfied, save your workflow. You can then schedule it to run automatically or trigger it manually.
6.  **Monitor Executions**: Check the "Executions" or "Dashboard" page to see the status and results of your running workflows.
